<h1>Flat Design Evolved</h1>


The iconic design style of the 2010s isn’t going anywhere... but it is evolving.
The flat design revolution has been gaining momentum with surprising speed over the last few years.
Considering its inherent simplicity, it’s not hard to see why: it makes any interface feel a little more intuitive,
it works well with responsive design and modern framework, and, or course, it looks amazing (when done right).
But the flat design style won’t stay stagnant, even if it does stay popular.
In the next year or so we can expect it to adapt to shifting needs and new creative insights.
How exactly will it change? Let’s take a look.



<h2>The New Flat Design</h2>

Starting as a rebellion against the dominating skeumorphic style,
flat design has since come into its own and is not more than just the “option B” that it used to be. Today, and in the near future, the style
is expanding and maturing into what Ryan Allen calls “Flat 2.0.” “Flat 2.0 is an evolution, not a revolution,” Allen wrote.
<q cite="">“Where flat design was a radical departure from the rampant skeuomorphism of days gone by,
flat 2.0 is a playful branch off the flat tree. Flat design is the Christmas tree, Flat 2.0 is the ornaments and candy canes. And
presents. No tinsel though, that stuff is a mess to clean up.”</q>

Originally flat design was rigorously flat, with little accentuation and a heavy emphasis on minimalism.
The new flat, however, is enjoying some more playful flourishes that make it “almost flat.”
Lately, we see more eye-catching elements, like hints of shadows and coloration, that flat purists would refute,
but the design community embraces for its cohesiveness with <a href="#">other popular design patterns</a>.


You can virtually see the flat design style evolve in the three examples below:

The <a href="#">HLK Agency</a> is strictly flat to further its minimalist atmosphere.
No flourishes, not distracting visuals – no nonsense.

The <a href="#">Agency Survival kit</a>, on the other hand, takes a few liberties like shading and texture, while still remaining predominantly flat.

Last, the <a href="#">Forest App</a> site is more like a flat hybrid, combining the
simplistic elements of flat design with photo realism.

<h2>5 Characteristic Components of Flat Design</h2>

Influenced by Swiss/international design and artistic minimalism,
lat design utilizes techniques from various mediums and eras and draws them together in something all its own.
 Here are the five most recognizable techniques the new flat design uses to set itself apart from competing styles,
 including its origins.

Part of Flat 2.0, <a href="#">long shadows</a> add a depth and complexity with- out sacrificing the minimalistic elements that make flat design appealing.

While last year saw the trend of longer, more noir-ish shadows,
lately the trend has been moving towards subtlety. In the above example from <a href="#">Duffy & Partners</a>,
the product’s shadow (and reflec- tion) are slight and unobtrusive,
but still add a little extra visual interest.

To make up for the sparse visual effects, flat design implements a dynamic usage of color,
especially bright hues. The energizing colors contrasted with one another keep a page of few elements from appearing dull.

Because color usage is so crucial in flat design, the site <a href="#">Flat UI Colors</a> collected some of the most effective of these patterns.
